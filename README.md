# SCRUNCHIE WORLD!
## RAD to the MAX!

We know, deep down inside, we've all wanted a place to get together and discuss the wide and massively varied world of scrunchies.  As an iconic fashion accessory, the humble scrunchie has long lacked a domain for user-generated reviews.
Fret no longer!  Scrunchie World is here to provide a place of open discussion.

First things first, a new user needs to sign up:

Once securely signed up, the user (you) will remain logged in until they choose to log out (allowing for someone else in the house to finally get a chance to review their faves).

This is where the fun starts!  If you're anything like me, you're going to want to get right to it.  Clicking on the "Link New Product" button will take you over to your personalized page of all available scrunchies yet to be linked to your account.  Find any that you'd like to claim and continue.

Link as many products as you own and wish to discuss.  From the upper-right corner of your homepage, you can begin the process of adding reviews.

![navigation](./Readme_Images/navBar.png)

Up at the top of the page sits the Navigation Bar. Here are links to all products (whether you've linked them or not), brands (for viewing and adding), groups (for viewing and adding) and the collection of reviews.  On the review page, you can delete or edit your own reviews and see what everyone else has to say about their favorite (and not-so-favorite) products.

But let's go back to Groups, shall we.

This is where you can get together with other members and form a posse of like-minded scrunchie fans.  Be careful, though, you can only be in a single-group at a time.  To join a new group, you muse leave your current group.

## Have fun and remember, NEVER STOP SCRUNCHIN'!
